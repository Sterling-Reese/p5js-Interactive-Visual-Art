# Interactive Visual Arts Simulation

## Description
An interactive art piece where 100 dynamic circle objects, instantiated from a `Food` class, move randomly on the canvas. The user can interact with the simulation by "removing" the circles with a mouse click.

## Technologies Used
* **Languages:** JavaScript
* **Libraries:** p5.js

## Features
* **Object-Oriented Design:** A `Food` class encapsulates the properties (position, color, size) and methods (`display`, `move`, `hit`) for each circle.
* **Dynamic Behavior:** Each object's movement and color are randomized to create a dynamic, generative art piece.
* **User Interaction:** Implements mouse-based hit detection using the `dist()` function to allow for user interaction.
